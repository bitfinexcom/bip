## Goals
* Demonstrate solvency and custody for a certain crypto-currency / digital asset with a transparent and mathematical proof
* Protect customers' privacy

## Proposal

* Every account balance is split into random buckets, maybe within a range that we can determine
  emperically from Exchange user data, to hide the exact user balance from other users, and anonymise
  individual users and their wealth
* Each account is assigned a asym. keypair per bucket, where Exchange signs the value in the bucket
  and then shares the key pair confidentially with the user account. The secret key allows the user
  to prove that they own a public key in case of a dispute.
* All signed values are published in a public ledger, akin to a Merkle-set. This Merkle-set is a tree
  where each node contain the sum of their children, and ultimately, at the root contains the total
  sum of the tree. Lookup of a specific node is efficient in time/memory. This set can be rebuild
  periodically using the above steps. A user can check their buckets efficiently and verify that
  the keys they have available are only ever used to sign once.
* Users can choose to publish their list of public keys, so other users can check that they were
  not given the same public key. This also incetivices Exchange to not give two users the same
  public key, as this discovery would be catastrophic to their reputation, even if the chance was
  small. The more users choose to publish their keys, the higher the confidence in the buckets
  representing actual users.
* The top sum needs to be externally verifiable by users. One idea could be to reference enough
  wallets on the blockchain, so their sum is greater than or equal to the purported sum in the
  Merkle-set
* One thing to note is that splitting into random buckets is against the game theory optimal
  strategy for Exchange, but is a trade-off between user privacy and trust in Exchange.
  It would be more trustworthy the less buckets are in the feed as it is against Exchange
  interest to report very few users, but the tradeoff is how to keep users exact balance
  secret.
  
  
## Future, speculative enhancements

* Assuming a Merkle-set, rebuild periodically, but abandon the idea of buckets,
  it may be possible use homomorphic encryption or zero-knowledge proofs to show
  that each user has a certain balance, whithout revealing the exact balance to others than
  themselves, but design a way such that the root sum can be verified by anybody.
  Each node should still be able to be tied to an actual user, so they can choose to publish
  that a node represents them, without revealing their wealth
* Assuming a Merkle-set, but acting as a feed, and keeping the ideas of buckets,
  we could aggregate daily transaction changes on a user basis and publish negative
  entries to the merkle-set, so it could be updated over time instead of being rebuilt.
  Extra care would need to be taken in adding noise as to not reveal precise Exchange
  activity.
  
  
## Other Applications

### Vote Delegation: transparent off-chain voting feature

* Every account can vote for a proposal using his account balance as a stake
* An account can split/weight his stake across multiple options
* All signed votes (and relative options) are attached as a signed payload to the relative node
